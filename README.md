# SimpleNotes
Simple Notes is a lightweight, web-based note-taking application that I developed as my **Final Project for CS50x**, Harvard Universityâ€™s Introduction to Computer Science. The main goal of this project was to create something small, easy to understand, and functional that demonstrates the three core layers of full-stack web development: the frontend, the backend, and the database.

This project combines **Python (using the Flask framework)**, **SQLite** for data storage, and **JavaScript** for client-side interaction. It allows users to create, view, and delete short notes instantly from their browser without refreshing the page. Everything is saved locally in an SQLite database, so notes persist even when the server is restarted.

When I began this project, I wanted something simple but not trivial. I wanted it to feel like a real application that someone could actually use every day, while keeping it small enough to finish and understand fully within the timeframe of the course. I also wanted to make sure it reflected the fundamental skills that CS50 taught: problem solving, logical thinking, code organization, and clear documentation.
